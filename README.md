## Introduction

Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is critical for diagnosing heart arrhythmias. This project focuses on classifying ECG signals to identify various arrhythmias using advanced algorithms. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate model that can be utilized in healthcare systems to support clinicians.

---

## Dataset

The notebook uses publicly available ECG datasets (e.g., **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** or any other dataset you used). The dataset includes labeled ECG signals representing different arrhythmias, as well as normal sinus rhythm.

- **Number of Samples**:
abnormal.shape, normal.shape
((10506, 187), (4046, 187))
- **Classes**: [ e.g., normal, abnormal.]
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Signal filtering
  - Noise reduction
  - Feature extraction

---

## Methodology

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the ECG signals.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting key features from the ECG waveforms.
3. **Model Development**: Training and testing machine learning/deep learning models for classification.
   - Algorithms used: [e.g., CNN, RNN, or others]
4. **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
